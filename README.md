## 🚀 Features

- **Client-Side Encryption:** Securely encrypt files or text using AES-GCM directly in your browser.
- **Two Encryption Modes:**
  - **Password Protected (`P:`)** — Uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive a strong key from your password.
  - **Passwordless (`K:`)** — Generates a random key and embeds it in the output for quick scrambling.
- **Large File Support:** Download encrypted output as `.txt` to bypass clipboard limits and re-import for decryption.
- **Integrity Checker:** Verify files using a built-in SHA-256 hash calculator.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive interface with smooth GSAP-powered animations.

## 🛡️ Privacy by Design

This isn’t just a promise—it’s enforced by architecture.

- **100% Client-Side:** All encryption, decryption, and hashing are handled via the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). No data is sent to any server.
- **No Backend, No Database:** WhisperBin stores nothing. Once you close the tab, your data is gone.
- **Open Source:** Every line of code is publicly available for inspection and verification.

## ⚙️ How It Works

WhisperBin uses two encryption modes, each with a distinct output prefix:

### 🔐 `P:` Mode — Password Protected

1. You provide a file or text and a password.
2. A random 16-byte salt is generated.
3. PBKDF2 derives a 256-bit key using SHA-256 and 100,000 iterations.
4. AES-GCM encrypts the data with a random 12-byte IV.
5. Output format:
   ```
   P:<filename>.<filetype>.<salt>.<iv>.<encrypted_data>
   ```

### 🔓 `K:` Mode — Passwordless

1. You provide a file or text (no password required).
2. A random 256-bit AES-GCM key is generated.
3. AES-GCM encrypts the data with a random 12-byte IV.
4. Output format:
   ```
   K:<filename>.<filetype>.<raw_key>.<iv>.<encrypted_data>
   ```
