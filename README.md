## üöÄ Key Features

* **Secure In-Browser Encryption:** Encrypt files or text using modern cryptographic standards (AES-GCM) right on your device.
* **Flexible Security Modes:**
    * [cite_start]**Password Protected (Prefix `P:`):** Uses your password to generate a strong encryption key via PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) [cite: 207, 214-215].
    * **Passwordless (Prefix `K:`):** Creates a random key and embeds it in the output code. [cite_start]Ideal for quickly "scrambling" data [cite: 216-218].
* **Large File Handling:** Bypasses mobile clipboard limits by allowing you to **download** the encrypted code as a `.txt` file and **import** it back for decryption.
* **File Integrity Checker:** Verify files with an SHA-256 hash calculator tool (which also runs 100% in-browser).
* **Modern Interface:** A smooth, responsive UI with animations powered by GSAP.

## üõ°Ô∏è Your Data Never Leaves Your Device

This isn't a promise; it's an architectural constraint. Your security is our first priority.

* **100% Client-Side**
    All processes‚Äîencryption, decryption, and hashing‚Äîhappen inside your browser using the standard [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). [cite_start]Your file is never uploaded to any server [cite: 52-53].

* **No Server, No Database**
    This application has no backend or database. [cite_start]We do not store your files, text, or passwords [cite: 54-56]. Once you close the browser tab, that sensitive data is gone.

* **Completely Open Source**
    The entire project code is open to the public. [cite_start]You or anyone can inspect every line of code to verify that we never transmit or store your data [cite: 57-58].

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Technical Details)

The application runs in two distinct modes, identifiable by the output code prefix.

### 1. `P:` Mode (Password Protected)

This is the most secure mode, ideal for protecting sensitive data.

1.  **Input:** You provide a file/text and a password.
2.  **Salt:** A random 16-byte cryptographic `salt` is created.
3.  **Key Derivation:** Your password and the `salt` are processed via **PBKDF2** with **100,000 iterations** and **SHA-256** to generate a secure 256-bit encryption key.
4.  **Encryption:** Your data is encrypted using **AES-GCM** with a random 12-byte `iv`.
5.  **Output (`P:`):** The output code is a Base64URL concatenation of:
    `P:<filename>.<filetype>.<salt>.<iv>.<encrypted_data>`.

### 2. `K:` Mode (Passwordless)

This mode is faster and useful if you just want to "scramble" data so it can't be read directly.

1.  **Input:** You provide a file/text (no password).
2.  **Random Key:** Instead of PBKDF2, we directly create a strong, random 256-bit AES-GCM `CryptoKey`.
3.  **Encryption:** Your data is encrypted using that random key and a random 12-byte `iv`.
4.  [cite_start]**Output (`K:`):** The random key is exported as raw data and combined into the output [cite: 217-218]:
    `K:<filename>.<filetype>.<raw_key>.<iv>.<encrypted_data>`.
